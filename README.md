# Cache Poisoning Attack over DNS - PoC

Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical internet protocol that provides a way to resolve domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.  </br>
DNS is known to be vulnerable to a widespread attack called DNS poisoning. Our article aims to study the Domain Name System and the mechanism of DNS cache poisoning.  </br>
Our paper will present countermeasures used against this type of attack and why is important that future research should be oriented towards introducing more
trustworthy countermeasures against DNS cache poisoning.  </br>

We have created a demo using the Ettercap tool to create a Cache Poisoning Attack over DNS.  </br>
